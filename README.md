- Developed a web-based software using ASP.NET framework with C# and a Microsoft SQL Server database to assist managers and support workers of people with Autism. This was a NYSID (New York State for Industries for the Disabled, Inc.) CREATE (Cultivating Resources for Employment with Assistive TEchnology) for the year 2022-2023. 
- Software included a web-based clocking-in system where employees are shown their workstation for the concurrent day, with the managers and support workers getting mobile notifications of the employee. The employee can also notify their managers for any additional assistance, bathroom breaks, etc. 
- The managers can receive a weekly report from the employee and see the data prediction model of the frequency of certain activities based on the given workstation. This model allows managers to visualize whether certain employees may experience difficulties communicating with the manager about their disinterest in a particular task.
